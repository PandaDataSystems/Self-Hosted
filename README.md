# Self-Hosted List

Self-hosting is the practice of locally hosting and managing applications instead of renting from [SaaSS](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/who-does-that-server-really-serve.html) providers.

This is a list of [Free](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software) Software [network services](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_service) and [web applications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_application) which can be hosted locally. Non-Free software is listed on the [Non-Free](non-free.md) page.

See [Contributing](.github/CONTRIBUTING.md).
